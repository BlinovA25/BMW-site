# BMW generations site

Site written with the help of html, css and JS. It also contains version for smaller devices that has couple of differences from actual desktop version.

You can visit the site here https://blinova25.github.io/BMW-site/MainPage.

P.S. It's not a best example of how you should make your sites, but you can take some features from here.
